## TyperCat
A simple typing game, akin to Typer Shark. Created as our final project for CMSC 22.

## App Usage
There are three difficulties, namely easy, normal, and expert. Each difficulty has its own dictionary of words, specifically four-letter words, six-letter words, and eight-letter words, respectively. 
The player must finish typing the word displayed on screen before the cat reaches the open jaw of the shark. Wrong inputs incur a penalty of the cat jumping forward. 
Players gain points by completing words.

### Controls
1. Keyboard - Input
2. [Spacebar] - Pause/Resume
